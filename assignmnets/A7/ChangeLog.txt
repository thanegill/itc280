TODO:

Added smartTitle() not documented or an example made.

Need demos of rotate() and randomize() and integrate with htmlSelector/pageSelector

Want to add flashMessage() support for all feedback - this means changing iformReq(), et al.
May also mean a change to mysqli only - we'll see!
change to loadFeedback() and showFeedback() instead of get/showFlash()? needs demo and integration with iFormReq, etc.
add common stylesheet, common.css to provide styles for flash messages - add to meta_inc.php

build getContent() function to retrieve content from: include file, SQL, HTML, etc.
htmlSelector needs to be changed to pageSelector()?

Document addLink() function
