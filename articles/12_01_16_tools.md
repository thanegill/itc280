## Web Development

- [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) is my go to editor for everything. It can handle anything that you can think of from CSS to Objective C.
- [CSSEdit/Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/) are a great bundle of apps for web development. CSSEdit I use solely for editing all CSS. I use Espresso occasionally for HTML and PHP when I want a live preview of what I'm editing. Both Espresso and CSS Edit have very good auto complete. I've also been using [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/) recently and it's A good competitor to the Espresso/CSSEdit combo. But I find that it's hard to use the single window that switching between window like the MacRabbit software.
- [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) is the the best FTP client I have ever used. It's extremely fast and easy to use. If you want a free option [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch/) is great for both mac and PC's.
- [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) (Macintosh - Apache - MySQL - PHP) is what I use for testing PHP sites locally, or even hosting sites on the internet form my server for my clients to see. It's very simple to use and has many features and really the only option for locally hosted PHP sites.
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

## Productivity

*   Mac OSX's built in [TextEdit](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2523) is what I use for all text that doesn't need to be formatted or printed. I'm try to move to TextMate for this but the muscle memory hasn't set in yet.
*   For the text that does need to be printed I use the industry standard [Microsoft Office 201\. for Macs](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products).
*   My todo list is [Wunderlist](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/). It's a very simple syncing todo list and not much more and that's why I love it.
*   I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) for notes and anything that I want to sync to my phone.

## Graphic and Photo

- [The Adobe Creative Suite 5.5](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/web.html) is what I use for all graphic and photographic needs. I also use [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/) for basic photo editing and library organization.
*   For mind maps, network diagrams, and flow charts I use [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/).

## Communication

*   I use [Adium](http://adium.im/) for all chat need. Sometimes I venture over to [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), although it's really a crappy piece of software.
*   I also use [Twitter for Mac](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12), really only for following other people. I don't tweet myself that much.

## Utilities

- [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) for bit torrent.
- [Drop Box](https://www.dropbox.com/) for document backup and sync.
- [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/) for full wireless nightly backups.
- [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management.
- [Screens](http://edovia.com/screens) as a VNC client.
- [AirFoil](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/) for wireless music streaming to my stereo via an [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/).
- [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) for running Windows or any testbed operating systems.
*   And many, many more, but these are the most used by me.

## All Other

- [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) for [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) reading and RSS syncing to the mobile version of Reeder.
- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) for my browser of choice, complete with cross computer syncing and a slew of plug-ins.
