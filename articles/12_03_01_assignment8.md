Title: Eight &#10093;&#10093; List & View
Type: assignment
Date: 2012-03-01
Time Spent: 120

This site is created with a list and view model. Each article has its own page that looks like this: `http://itc280.psophis.com/?p=assignment-seven-theming`. They only problem that I can see with this is if I have two articles with that same title.

It is also possible to sort by type like this: `http://itc280.psophis.com/?t=assignment`.

There are some differences from the assignment. One is that I am not running this from MySQL. I'm running it as a file based CMS, where each article is a separate file. Two is that I don't have any images that are linked. I can easily add this if it is need for the assignment. Bill said that it was ok as is.
