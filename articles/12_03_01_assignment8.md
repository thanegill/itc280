Title: Eight &#10093;&#10093; List & View
Type: assignment
Date: 2012-03-01
Time Spent: 120

This site is created with a alist and view model. Each articel has its own page that looks like this: `http://itc280.thanegill.com/posts/?p=assignment-seven-theming`. They only problem that I can see with this is if I have two articles with that same title. It is also possible to sort by type like this: `http://itc280.thanegill.com/posts/?t=assignment`.

There are some diffrences from the assigment. One is that I am not runnging this form MySQL. I'm runnign as a file based CMS, where eatch article is a sperate file. Two is that I don't have any images that are linked. I can eaasily add this if it is need for the assignment. Bill said that it was ok as is.
